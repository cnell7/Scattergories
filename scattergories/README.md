# Development   

## Front End  
```bash   
npm run watch   
```   
Will re-build everytime you make a change in the src folder so that the back end may use your changes.   

## Back End   
```bash   
nodemon server   
```   
This will start the server and watch for any changes on the backend so you won't have to restart.
